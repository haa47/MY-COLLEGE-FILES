# MY-COLLEGE-FILES
Hello Reader, 

My Name is Haaris Ajmeri

WELCOME To my College Files Repsoitory that includes collection of all my 8 semesters aka 4 years Files of My B.Tech IT in BHAGWAN MAHAVIR UNIVERSITY 2021 - 2025. which includes assignments, Practicals, Syllabus and maybe other stuff that can be useful for study. Now keep in My mind these files are based on my 2021 to 2025 B.tech Batch of BHAGWAN MAHAVIR UNIVERSITY so things maybe different because of the later year admission of B.Tech IT may have more updated and different course plan than mine but hopefully the things that does matach helps. This Repository is for EVERYONE so feel free to use and share to your friends and anyone in need.

This repository is not represent itself a definitive resource or "TOTALLY HELPFUL".

which is why if your also a BMU student/faculty or GOD SEND OPEN SOURCE ANGEL or maybe other college student that coincidentally there syllabus matches with this content and notices some obvious contents are missing and wants to help then feel free to send request and other stuff that helps to make the collection complete and becomes more expanded and helpful for everyone.
Note - The contents that are been shared to add to the repository will be analyzed by myself or maybe professional faculties but keep that in mind we don't condone 100% accuracy for it and sometimes we may forgot          to check/notice sensitive information in your content, so please either remove the sensitive information in the content to make the process much easier to flow but do not worry if we noticed a sensitive             information i will contact you for it's removal but still since we are human beings errors are definite so please share files on your own risk.

Disclaimer - some contents of the Repositories are been made by my friends so technically i don't condone myself as those content original creator.
             and to those who wants to share/add some files in the repository: 
             1) you should accept the fact that you are allowing everyone to access it or else do not share it very simple because of it being a public repository which don't ask later for it's permanent removal                    since it can be useful to everyone
             2) the contents your sharing will be at your own risk so please remove any sensitive information in the content which also if we didn't notice the sensitive information while analyzing the content you                  shared you are at your own risk which please contact/inform me for it's removal for to edit the content
             3) Please do not send troll stuff or any irrelevant stuff to be requested to be shared to the repository which end up wasting up time
